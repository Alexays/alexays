### Hi there 👋

I'm a Developer since 2012, I am both a lead tech, lead developer or full-stack developer thanks to my technical and management skills which allow me to interact and manage the whole project, from its idea, conception, design, development, production and follow-up, which is which makes me the ideal person for projects in your company.

All my experience, open-source projects, freelancing and adaptability allow me to take on new technical stacks and to integrate new teams quickly.
